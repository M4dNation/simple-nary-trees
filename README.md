## About

`simple-nary-trees` is a package for creating a nary-tree structure.  
It provides two classes `Tree` and `TreeNode` you can instanciate and populate with any data you want.

## Install

`npm install --save simple-nary-trees`  
`yarn add simple-nary-trees`

## Usage

`simple-nary-trees` exports a `Tree` and a `TreeNode` classes you can import:

```javascript
// ES6
import { Tree, TreeNode } from "simple-nary-trees";

// ES5
const Tree = require("simple-nary-trees").Tree;
const TreeNode = require("simple-nary-trees").TreeNode;
```

Once imported, you just have to instanciate a Tree and add data to have an usable tree structure.

```javascript
import { Tree } from "simple-nary-trees";

const tree = new Tree();
const node = new TreeNode("node-id");
const secondNode = new TreeNode("second-id");

tree.root = node;
tree.addNode(secondNode, "node-id");
```

We do suggest you extends the TreeNode class to create your own representation of a tree node.
The common pattern is the following:

```javascript
import { TreeNode } from "simple-nary-trees";

class MyTreeNode extends TreeNode {
  constructor({ id, name }) {
    super(id);

    // You can use whatever suits you for your data
    this.name = name;
  }
}
```
